Decorator
=============
The Decorator pattern adds new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.

Purpose
-------
- Dynamically add new functionality to class instances.
- Decorators provide a flexible alternative to inheritance for extending functionality.
- Wrapping a present, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.

Terminology
-----------
- Component defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
- ConcreteComponent defines an object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
- Decorator maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Componentâ€™s interface.
- ConcreteDecorator adds responsibilities to the component.

Examples
--------

-  Web Service Layer: Decorators JSON and XML for a REST service (in this case, only one of these should be allowed of course)
